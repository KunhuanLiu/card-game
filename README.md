# card-game
This work is the final project submission for CSC 122: data structure, finished on my own in Fall 2015.
It is a card game implementing "perpetual motion" rules --a solitaire that is used for killing time.
Although it is the first time creating a GUI system, it only took 10 hours to finish it, thanks to using UML diagram and good design principle.

Implemented rules can be found here:
